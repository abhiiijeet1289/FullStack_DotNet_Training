# Introduction to .NET Core

## What is .NET Core?
.NET Core (now unified under ".NET") is a free, open-source, cross-platform development platform for building apps on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It supports multiple application types: console, web, cloud, microservices, desktop, mobile, and IoT.

### Benefits of .NET Core
- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- High performance and scalability
- Unified Base Class Library (BCL)
- Side-by-side versioning
- Modern tooling: `dotnet` CLI, minimal hosting model

### What’s new (modern .NET highlights)
- Minimal hosting model for ASP.NET Core
- Performance improvements (JIT, GC, containers)
- Modern C# language features (records, pattern matching, spans)

### .NET Core vs .NET Framework
- **.NET Core/.NET**: cross-platform, open-source, modern apps
- **.NET Framework**: Windows-only, legacy enterprise apps

## First .NET Application (Console)
We’ll build a small console app (Calculator) to demonstrate .NET Core basics.
