# Building Blocks of Angular

## 1. Modules (@NgModule)
- Containers for cohesive blocks of code
- Every Angular app has at least one module (root module)
- Organizes components, directives, pipes, and services

## 2. Components
- Basic building blocks of UI
- Controls a patch of screen called a view
- Defined with @Component decorator

## 3. Templates
- HTML with Angular markup
- Defines component's view
- Can include Angular directives and binding expressions

## 4. Services
- Classes that handle data and business logic
- Can be injected into components
- Marked with @Injectable decorator

## 5. Dependency Injection
- Design pattern for creating and delivering dependencies
- Angular's built-in DI system manages service instances
